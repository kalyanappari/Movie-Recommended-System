# Movie-Recommended-System
A Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. The system typically employs various recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to deliver personalized movie suggestions.

Key Components:
Data Collection:

The system requires a large dataset of movies, user ratings, and other features like genres, directors, cast, and more. Popular datasets like MovieLens are commonly used.
Data Preprocessing:

The collected data is cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for training machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.
Recommendation Algorithms:

Collaborative Filtering:
Utilizes user behavior (e.g., past ratings) to recommend movies based on the preferences of similar users. It can be user-based (users with similar tastes) or item-based (movies that are often rated similarly).
Content-based Filtering:
Recommends movies based on the attributes of the items (movies) themselves. For instance, if a user enjoys action movies with a certain director, the system suggests similar movies.
Hybrid Approaches:
Combines both collaborative and content-based methods to improve recommendation accuracy and minimize limitations from either approach.
Model Training:

Machine learning models such as matrix factorization techniques (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition - SVD) or deep learning models (e.g., Autoencoders, Neural Collaborative Filtering) can be used to train the recommendation system on user-movie interaction data.
Evaluation:

The system is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for rating predictions or Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for ranking accuracy. Cross-validation is often employed to validate model performance.
User Interface:

The recommendation system provides a front-end interface where users can see movie recommendations, search for movies, and provide feedback (e.g., ratings, likes/dislikes) to further enhance the recommendation engine.
Deployment:

Once the model is trained and fine-tuned, it is deployed on a web-based or mobile platform where users can interact with it. The system continually learns from user interactions to improve future recommendations.
Technologies and Tools:
Programming Languages: Python, R
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Surprise, LightFM
Web Frameworks: streamlit library(for building the front-end)
APIs: TheMovieDB API, OMDb API for fetching additional movie metadata.
Use Cases:
Personalized movie recommendations for users based on their viewing history.
Enhanced user engagement through tailored movie suggestions.
Integration into streaming platforms, improving the user experience.
This project showcases the use of machine learning to solve real-world problems in personalization and recommendation systems.
